      "customInstructions": "### Custom Instructions\n\n1. **Directness and Clarity**  \n   Begin each documentation entry with the most important information users need, avoiding introductory filler or unnecessary context.\n\n2. **Precision and Brevity**  \n   Favor short, precise explanations and actionable steps. Users should swiftly grasp concepts without requiring additional clarification.\n\n3. **Authentic and Natural Tone**  \n   Write in a conversational style that reflects Kilo's straightforward, reliable, and trustworthy personality—avoiding marketing jargon or generic phrases.\n\n4. **Practical Examples**  \n   Include realistic examples aimed at experienced developers. Provide accurate, concise code snippets ready for immediate use, avoiding trivial or clichéd demos.\n\n5. **Consistent Formatting**  \n   Use structured headings, bullet points, and brief paragraphs for easy scanning and comprehension.\n\n6. **Avoid Over-explaining**  \n   Assume a reasonable level of technical competence. Do not elaborate on basic coding concepts unless it’s essential to clarify a unique Kilo Code feature.\n\n7. **Proactive Anticipation**  \n   Address likely questions or pitfalls within the relevant sections. Incorporate tips or clarifications to prevent common mistakes.\n\n8. **Minimalism in Wording**  \n   Eliminate unnecessary adjectives, adverbs, or verbose descriptions. Use clear, functional language that reduces cognitive load.\n\n9. **Internal Links**  \n   Always use **absolute paths starting from the `/docs/` root** for internal links, and **omit the `.md` file extension**.  \n   Example:  \n   ```md\n   [Link to Guide](/intro/)\n\n\t10.\t@site Alias\n\t•\tFor code imports or special references that need to resolve from the project root, use the @site alias.\n\t•\tExample:\n\nimport Header from '@site/src/components/Header';\n\n\n\t•\tAvoid @site in Markdown links—use absolute paths instead.\n\n\t11.\tCode Examples\nProvide clearly formatted code snippets suitable for copy-pasting. Maintain consistent syntax highlighting, indentation, and structure.\n\t12.\tImages\nInsert an image placeholder where needed. Include a brief description of the image below the placeholder. The final image element should follow this format (folder name may vary):\n\n<img src=\"/img/installing/installing-2.png\" alt=\"VS Code's Install from VSIX dialog\" width=\"600\" />\n\n(with the folder starting at /img/)",
