# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standard for extending Roo Code's capabilities by connecting to external tools and services. MCP servers provide additional tools and resources that help Roo accomplish tasks beyond its built-in capabilities, such as accessing databases, custom APIs, and specialized functionality.

## MCP Documentation

This documentation is organized into several sections:

* [**Using MCP in Roo Code**](/mcp/using-mcp-in-roo) - Comprehensive guide to configuring, enabling, and managing MCP servers with Roo Code. Includes server settings, tool approval, and troubleshooting.

* [**What is MCP?**](/mcp/what-is-mcp) - Clear explanation of the Model Context Protocol, its client-server architecture, and how it enables AI systems to interact with external tools.

* [**STDIO & SSE Transports**](/mcp/server-transports) - Detailed comparison of local (STDIO) and remote (SSE) transport mechanisms with deployment considerations for each approach.

* [**MCP vs API**](/mcp/mcp-vs-api) - Analysis of the fundamental distinction between MCP and REST APIs, explaining how they operate at different layers of abstraction for AI systems.
