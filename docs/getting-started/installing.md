- [**Open VSX Registry**](#open-vsx-registry) - for VS Code-compatible editors like VSCodium or Windsurf
- [**Manually install the .vsix file**](#manual-installation-from-vsix) - direct installation from the GitHub Release

## Open VSX Registry

[Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/) is an open-source alternative to the VS Code Marketplace for VS Code-compatible editors that cannot access the official marketplace due to licensing restrictions.

For VS Code-compatible editors like VSCodium, Gitpod, Eclipse Theia, and Windsurf, you can browse and install directly from the [Kilo Code page on Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/kilocode/Kilo-Code).

1. Open your editor
2. Access the Extensions view (Side Bar icon or `Ctrl+Shift+X` / `Cmd+Shift+X`)
3. Your editor should be pre-configured to use Open VSX Registry
4. Search for "Kilo Code"
5. Select "Kilo Code" and click **Install**
6. Reload the editor if prompted

:::note
If your editor isn't automatically configured for Open VSX Registry, you may need to set it as your extension marketplace in settings. Consult your specific editor's documentation for instructions.
