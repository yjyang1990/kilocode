# Installing Kilo Code

Kilo Code is a VS Code extension that brings AI-powered coding assistance directly to your editor. Install using one of these methods:
1. **VS Code Marketplace (Recommended)** - fastest method for standard VS Code and Cursor users
1. **Open VSX Registry** - for VS Code-compatible editors like VSCodium
1. **Manually install the .vsix file** - direct installation from the GitHub Release

## VS Code Marketplace

If you already have VS Code installed:

[Click here to install Kilo Code](vscode:extension/kilocode.Kilo-Code)

alternatively, you can:

1. Open VS Code
2. Access Extensions: Click the Extensions icon in the Side Bar or press `Ctrl+Shift+X` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+X` (macOS)
3. Search for "Kilo Code"
4. Select "Kilo Code" by Kilo Code and click **Install**
